# circplot package

The package provides some low levels functions (lines, rectangles, etc.) and a few higher level functions (boxplot, density plot, etc.) to plot in polar fashion. The package is very basic and used for some graphics in one of my publications. To get an overview of what plots can be created have a look at http://markheckmann.github.io/circplot.
